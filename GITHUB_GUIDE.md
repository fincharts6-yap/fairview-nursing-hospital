## Step 1: Create GitHub Account (Skip if you have one)

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" 
3. Enter your email, create a password, choose a username

## Step 3: Copy the Commands

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. **Copy these exactly:**

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username**
